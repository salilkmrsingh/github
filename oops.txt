1. How to create an Object in java ?
To create a new object in java we use new keyword.
Eg : suppose there is class named Movie.
We can create an object of this class using : Movie movie = new Movie();

2.What is the use of a new keyword in java?
 new keyword is used to create a new instance(object) of class.
Eg : suppose there is class named Movie.
We can create an object of this class using : Movie movie = new Movie();


3.what are the different types of variables in java ?
There are three types of variables in java:
	instance variable(created inside class without static keyword)
	static variable (created inside a class with static keyword)
	local variable : created inside a method(includes method parameters)

4.What is the difference between Instance variable and Local variables ?
Instance variables are created inside the class directly(without static keyword), but local variables are created inside the methods.
Instance variables are can accessed from outside the class based on the scenerio(it should be not private, etc) but local variables can accessed in the given method only.

5.In which area memory is allocated for instance variable and local variable?
Instance variables are kept in heap area. Local primitive variables are kept in stack area and local non-primitive variables are kept in heap area.

6.What is method overloading ?
In same class, if we create method with same name but different signatures(different parameters) , it is called method overloading

Eg. 	class Calc{
		public int add(int n1, int n2){
			return n1+n2;
		}
		public double add(double n1, double n2){
			return n1+n2;
		}
	}
