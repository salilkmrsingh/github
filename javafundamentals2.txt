1.What is Statically typed and Dynamically typed Programming Language ?
Statically typed => In these programming language, the type of variable have to be declared during declarations itself. Eg in java, we declare the variable with return type : int num;
Dynamically typed => In these programming language, the type of the variable is determined at runtime and need not be declared during declaration. Eg. in javascript , we declare the variable as : let num;

2.What is the variable in java ?
Variable is just an alias name for memory locations. In easy terms, it's something that stores the values that can change.

3.How to Assign a value to variable?
To assign value, we use assignment operator.

	int num = 5;
	
	int num2;
	num2=12;

4.What are Primitive Data types in java ?
Primitive Data types are the data types that stores literals(simple values).eg int, short, byte, char, etc

5.What are the identifiers in java?
Identifiers are basically the unique variable name through which we can identify them.

6.List the operators in java?
There are following types of operators in java:
	arithmetic operators : + - * / %
	increment/ decrement : ++ -- (pre and post)
	assignment operators : = += -= *= /= %=
	logical operators : || && 
	relational operators : < > == <= >= !=

7.Explain about increment and decrement operators and give an examples
Increment operator is used to increase the value by 1
Decrement operator is used to decrease the value by 1

They can pre and post:
	pre => does increment/decrement before assignment
	post => does assignment before increment/decrement 

	eg : 	int a,b;
		b=5;
		a = ++b;
		//a will be 6 and b will be 6

		int a,b;
		b=5;
		a = b++;
		//a will be 5 and b will be 6
