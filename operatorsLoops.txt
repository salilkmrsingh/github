1. What are the conditional operators in java ?
Conditional operator is an operator where we can return value based on conditions

Syntax : condition ? <return value for true> : <return value for false> 
Eg :	 String type = age<18 ? "Kid" : "adult";

2. What are the types of operators based on the number of operands ?
There are three types of operators based on number of operands :
	unary : contains one operand eg: increment/decrement operator
	binary : contains two operands eg: arithmetic operators
	ternary : contains three operands eg: conditional operator(only eg)

3.What is the use of switch case in java programming ?
We use switch case where have multiple possibilities based on condition.
Eg : we have show month based on the number of month:
	
	switch(number){

		case 1 : System.out.println("jan");break;
		case 2 : System.out.println("feb");break;
		case 3 : System.out.println("mar");break;
		case 4 : System.out.println("apr");break;
		case 5 : System.out.println("may");break;
		case 6 : System.out.println("jun");break;
		case 7 : System.out.println("jul");break;
		case 8 : System.out.println("aug");break;
		case 9 : System.out.println("sep");break;
		case 10 : System.out.println("oct");break;
		case 11 : System.out.println("nov");break;
		case 12 : System.out.println("dec");break;
		default : System.out.println("we don't have such months");

	}

4.what are the priority levels of arithmetic operation in java?
The priority of arithmetic operators are as : (* / %) > (+ -)

5.What are conditional statements and use of conditional statements in java ?
Conditional statement helps to execute statements based on some conditions :
Eg : 	if(age<18){
		System.out.println("kid");
	}else{
		System.out.println("adult");
	}

6. What is the syntax of if else statement ?
	if(condition){
		//statements to be executed for true 
	}else{
		//statements to be executed for false
	}
7.What are the 3 types of iterative statements in java ?
	1. For loop
	eg : for(int i=0 /*initialization*/ ;i<10 /*condition*/; i++ /*update*/){
		System.out.println(i); //statements to executed repeatedly
	}
	2. While loop
	eg : 	int i=0; /*initialization*/
		while(i<10 /*condition*/){
			System.out.println(i); //statements to executed repeatedly
			i++; /*update*/
		}
	3. Do while 
	eg : 	int i=0; /*initialization*/
		do{
			System.out.println(i); //statements to executed repeatedly
			i++; /*update*/
		}while(i<10 /*condition*/);

8.Write the difference between for loop and do-while loop?
In for loop the initilization , condition and update lies at the same place, but in do while these are scattered at three places
In for loop the condition is check before loop execution, but in do while the condition is check after loop execution
In for loop execution can happen zero or more times, but in do while loop the execution happens one or more times
For loop is very popular in use, but do while has has very limited and rare uses.

9.Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10.

class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for(int i=1;i<=10;i++){
            System.out.print(i+" ");
        }
    }   
}
